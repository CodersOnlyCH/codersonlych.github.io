        "DESCRIPTION": "Coders Only\nNix is a cutting-edge, immensely powerful tool that offers unique capabilities for developers, testers, and system administrators looking to create reproducible builds, environments, and setups. However, its complexity and steep learning curve can be daunting for many.\n\nIn this meetup, we’ll explore crafting a reproducible environment with Nix using flakes, direnv and some other tooling. This session will allow you to do first steps into Nix environments, defining such environments from official templates, creating your own environments and automatically loading them using direnv.",

        "SUMMARY": "Software Craft Study Group: Is efficiency a good thing?",
        "DESCRIPTION": "Coders Only\nJoin our next session of the Software Craft Study Group to discuss the talk \"Is efficiency a good thing?\" by Holly Cummins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQs1bTmU4g4\n\n**Please watch the talk before the meeting**. We will present a very short introduction to the topic, but that works better as a reminder than a replacement for watching. The main focus of the meeting is a free discussion where everyone can participate.\n\n**What is the Software Craft Study Group about?**\n\nWe want to take advantage of all the great content on Software Engineering available out there and learn from it to become better at our craft. These meetings give us an excuse to actually study these resources and a chance to ask each other questions for clarification as well as share our own experiences. It is also a great place to meet people.\n\nWe meet remotely, so you can join from anywhere! And don't hesitate to join if you are just starting your programming journey, as long as you are interested in the weekly topic this is the right place for you.\n\nIf you would like to keep the discussion going outside the meetings, join our Discord channel on the Coders Only server: https://discord.gg/QjxgPbF7Cu.\n\nYou can also suggest new topics for upcoming discussions or vote for existing suggestions in the topic-suggestions channel: https://discord.gg/WdgXGNxCUR\n\nWe also have [a collection of links from previous discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17EB2nw7be_kF0dqKq1ZL0cWZYkuobtrFQJQsXLUoNEw/edit). If you have a link you shared or mentioned in a previous session, feel free to add it there.",
