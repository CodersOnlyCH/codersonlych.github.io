This code of conduct exists to support something most of us already practice:
respectful, thoughtful, and inclusive interaction.

Most of you navigate situations with kindness and integrity. You behave in a
perfectly acceptable manner. You are decent human beings.

And the fact that you’re reading this shows that you care— that you’re
reflective about your actions and want to contribute to a healthy community.
That’s exactly what makes this document meaningful.

## Why this document exists

We strive to foster a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive space for software
engineers and crafters of all backgrounds and identities.

We believe that collaboration thrives when everyone feels safe, heard, and
valued. Our community is built on mutual trust, curiosity, and a shared
commitment to learning and improving—together.

But it’s not always obvious how these values translate into everyday behavior.
This document exists to offer guidance.

## Guidance

-   **We do not tolerate discrimination or exclusion.**
    Regardless of intent, such behavior causes harm and goes against our values.

-   **We understand that mistakes happen.**
    People grow. Missteps are part of being human, and what matters most is how
    we respond. We encourage reflection and dialogue. The Executive Board is
    available to support this process and to help navigate situations where
    trust or boundaries are unclear.

-   **We act to protect our shared space.**
    When someone repeatedly violates the spirit of this Code of Conduct or
    disregards the community’s boundaries, the Executive Board will take
    action, this may include the exclusion from the community. This is about
    protecting the integrity of what we’re building.

## If you witness or experience a problem

If you see behavior that goes against the spirit of this Code of Conduct, we
encourage you to speak up.

In most cases, the best first step is a direct, respectful conversation. Many
misunderstandings can be resolved through honest dialogue. But we also
understand that not everyone feels comfortable or safe initiating such
discussions.

If you feel uneasy addressing the issue yourself, or if a conversation doesn’t
lead to resolution, please reach out to any member of the Executive Board. We
are here to listen, offer guidance, and help find a constructive way forward.

We know that acknowledging conflict isn’t easy. You’re not alone—we’re here to
support you.
