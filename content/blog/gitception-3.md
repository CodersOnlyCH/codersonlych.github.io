Yay! Second deep dive into Git using Gitception! We discovered the magic behind branches and merging and had vivid discussions about workflows, improvement, integrity and discipline. Who would have expected branches to be so light-weight? And merge to be so simple? We also took a glance at frequently met references which we will discuss further in other sessions! Are you joining us as well?
