This year’s Global Day of Coderetreat (GDCR) 2024 was a milestone for our
community: for the first time, we hosted the event in two locations
simultaneously—at Wingtra in Zurich and megazord.studio in Bern!

Two Amazing Locations At Wingtra, Andrew Magerman once again took the lead in
hosting an outstanding event. Their offices provided the perfect environment
for creativity, allowing participants to fully immerse themselves in the
exercises. The space, the atmosphere, and the people made for a truly
inspiring day. And of course, the food was fantastic, keeping everyone
energized and engaged.

Meanwhile, at megazord.studio in Bern, Pablo hosted the event in an equally
incredible setting. The location, right next to the river, offered a unique
experience—we could even watch the bears in their park during breaks! The
catering was nothing short of magnificent, with a selection of deliberately
chosen food to support focus, creativity, and learning.

The Best Possible Environment for Growth Across both locations, the sessions
were engaging, the people were fantastic, and the atmosphere was perfect for
learning, experimenting, and improving. Whether it was diving deep into TDD,
exploring new programming paradigms, or reflecting on the craft of software
development, everyone walked away enriched by the experience.

A massive thank you to Andrew, Pablo, Wingtra, and megazord.studio for making
this possible. The first dual-location GDCR was an absolute success, and we
can’t wait to do it again next year!
