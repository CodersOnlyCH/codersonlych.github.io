Andrew Magerman did it again! On January 9th, we kicked off a new Book Study
Club—this time diving into [Robert Nystrom’s Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Every two weeks, participants
will gather online to discuss chapter by chapter, exploring the intricacies of
building interpreters from the ground up.

The group is full of cool and motivated people, eager to dissect the book,
exchange ideas, and deepen their understanding of language implementation. To
keep the conversation going between meetings, we also have a dedicated [Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/xw7wAUe2nx), open to anyone who wants to join in on
the discussion.

Huge thanks to Andrew for getting this started—we’re excited for the journey
ahead!
