On November 18th, Andrew Magerman hosted the Global Day of Coderetreat (GDCR)
2023 at Ergon, and it was a total success! From the very start, the energy in
the room was incredible—developers from different backgrounds came together to
sharpen their skills, experiment with new ideas, and most importantly, have
fun.

The sessions were engaging and insightful, with participants tackling the
challenges of Conway’s Game of Life in pairs, exploring TDD, refactoring
techniques, and different programming paradigms. Whether it was trying out a
new language, pushing the limits of test-driven development, or simply enjoying
the collaborative spirit, everyone walked away having learned something new.

And let’s talk about the food—it was amazing! Keeping minds sharp requires
proper fuel, and the catering did not disappoint. Great conversations flowed
alongside great meals, making the breaks just as enjoyable as the coding
sessions.

A huge shoutout to Andrew Magerman for organizing and facilitating such a
fantastic event, and to Ergon for providing the perfect venue. GDCR 2023 was a
blast, and we’re already looking forward to the next one!
