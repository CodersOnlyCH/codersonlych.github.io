  {{< box title="Coders Monthly" >}}
  Coders Monthly is where it all started—a casual meetup in a bar with good
  beer and great vibes. No fixed agenda, just organic discussions on keyboards,
  languages, frameworks, AI, OSes, and more. Whoever comes is the right person,
  and whatever is discussed is the right topic.
  [Join us](https://www.meetup.com/coders-only/events/), grab a drink, and talk
  tech!

  best practices, to learn together and refinine our craft. No matter your
  experience level, [join us](https://discord.gg/SR7BZ8RZq7) to exchange ideas,
  challenge assumptions, and grow as a developer.
