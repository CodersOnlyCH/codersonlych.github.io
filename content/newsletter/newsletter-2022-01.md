Dear all

We have great news, thanks to the amazing Corinna we'll have a new online series starting soon, a Software Craft Study Group.

<!--more-->

The first session is next Wednesday, 9th February, on Sandro Mancuso's talk:

**Does TDD Really Lead to Good Design?**

## What is the Software Craft Study Group about?

We want to take advantage of all the great content on Software Engineering available out there and learn from it to become better at our craft. These meetings give us an excuse to actually study these resources and a chance to ask each other questions for clarification as well as share our own experiences. It is also a great place to meet people.

We meet remotely (even if there is no pandemic going on), so you can join from anywhere!

If you want to help choose the next topics, join our reddit community, where you can suggest content and vote on suggestions. Also feel free to use the community for any other discussions.

[Check it out on Meetup and join in!](https://www.meetup.com/coders-only/events/283418764/)

Cheers, Geza
