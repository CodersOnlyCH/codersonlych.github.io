<!--more-->

Yesh! It's time again to announce one of the most thrilling events of the year: Global Day of Coderetreat (GDCR). This year, we're not only organizing the 13th edition in ZÃ¼rich but also the first-ever edition in Bern! Join us on November 9th, 2024 for an unforgettable experience! ðŸŽ‰

This day is all about practice and explorationâ€”a unique opportunity to dive deep into coding by working through mind-boggling constraints designed to challenge your approach and elevate the quality of your code. ðŸ¤¯ Every session is focused on learning and improving, whether you're refactoring, pairing, teaming, designing, architecting, thinking, slicing, ... you name it! All away from the pressure of "getting things done" ðŸ¦º

You'll be pairing with very down to earth and passionate developers within a welcoming community ðŸ¤—, tackling challenges that push the boundaries of your programming knowledge. Imagine packing a fist full of years of experience into an exhausting but incredibly rewarding dayâ€”that's what GDCR is all about!

Donâ€™t miss out on this chance to grow, learn, and connect with fellow coders. Get your ticket right now, mark your calendars, and get ready for a day dedicated to perfecting your craft. ðŸ’»âœ¨
