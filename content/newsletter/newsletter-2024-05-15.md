It is with excitement that we invite you to meet Dr Alistair Cockburn (pronounced CO-BURN) in Zurich, at his fascinating, practical, story based Q&A session.

<!--more-->

Alistair, a co-author of the Agile Manifesto, is the world expert on agile methodologies and use cases, internationally recognised for his expertise in project management and object-oriented design.

Stories answer questions in a wonderful, sometimes roundabout way that permits the inclusion of contextual details left out of straightforward answers. And they are much more fun to listen to.

In this Q&A session, Alistair will solicit questions from the audience and answer them in the somewhat unusual form by telling stories from the hundreds of projects and companies he has seen. Raise a question or two about any topics you care about, and watch to see what stories will show up to shed light on them.

You can also catch Alistair at one of his workshops whilst in Zurich in June 2024, on the 6th - Unifying user stories, use cases, story maps - and on the 7th - Heart of Agile Masterclass. For details see https://www.tickettailor.com/events/humansandtechnologyinc/1227048
