Hi all!

We still have some seats for this year's Global Day of Coderetreat in two weeks so join us!

<!--more-->

After the restarted Monthlies (btw the next one is on Thursday, 4th) this will be our first physical event for a while and we can't wait to see you again.

This is also an immensely insightful and fun event. Nothing beats sitting shoulder to shoulder fighting the problem and the constraints and making discoveries and experiences on the way that are for life. So join in the fun!

Check the website for details. And book your seat!

Your friends from Coders Only
