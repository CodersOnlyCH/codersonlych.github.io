Hi all!

We've got THE BESTEST NEWS EVER!

Global Day of Coderetreat is happening for real on **Saturday, 13 November**, at [Ergon](https://www.ergon.ch/de).

<!--more-->

This is HUUUUUGE and you really should not miss out. This will be our tenth year at it, it's always incredibly fun, seats are always limited, we are always full, so it's always a good idea to get yours ASAP. Tomorrow evening it will go up on Meetup, and then it'll get full in no time, and you really don't want to miss out being stuck on the waitlist. So get yours while you can!

Check the website for details. And book your seat!

Your friends from Coders Only
