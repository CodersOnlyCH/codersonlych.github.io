Global Day of Coderetreat is a day of learning - we pair program (always with different partners) in a series of increasingly difficult tasks. A perfect way to learn cool new stuff.

We'll be pair programming throughout the day, on a small problem, always from scratch.

**Please bring a laptop with your favourite development environment(s) set up for the language(s) you are comfortable with or are interested in trying**. There will be six sessions during the day, with varying pairs, so you'll have ample choice in languages and environments.

A test-driven development style will be called for at least once, so **please also make sure to have the necessary test frameworks/harnesses/environments in place**. A blank hello-world workspace with a working test is a good starting point. Also, please have a version control system (git, hg, svn, etc.) ready to roll, for we may do a session where speedy commit/rollback will be part of the exercise.
Looking forward to seeing you there!

**CodersOnly**

Oliver, Andrew and Pablo
