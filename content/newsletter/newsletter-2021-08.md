Hi all

Would you believe, this is the very first newsletter from our new newsletter platform! And it's a good one!

<!--more-->

[SoCraTes Day Switzerland](https://socrates-day.ch/) is happening ONLINE on **Friday, 24th September 2021**.

SoCraTes Day is an International Conference for Software Craft and Testing, a single-day version of the full [SoCraTes Conferences](http://www.socrates-conference.de/home). It provides an ideal setting for speaking to and coding with other talented and engaged developers, letting us learn from and with each other.

Given the ongoing Coronavirus situation and after careful consideration with our hosts [Ergon Informatik](https://www.ergon.ch/de), we decided to keep this year’s event online. We thank for your understanding and hope to see many of you. We firmly believe given the spirit and engagement of our participants, we can make this an amazing experience, just like last year. Don’t miss out!

We will notify you about what to expect and how to prepare in due time.
