As a non-profit association, we rely on the support of companies that share our
vision of high-quality software development. Sponsorship allows us to provide
free or low-cost access to our events, secure venues, and offer refreshments to
participants—helping us create an environment where meaningful discussions and
skill development can flourish.

## Why Sponsor Coders Only?

By supporting us, you gain visibility among a dedicated audience of software
engineers, architects, and industry leaders who are committed to continuous
learning and improvement. As a sponsor, you will:

- *Support the growth of Swiss software craftsmanship*: Your contribution helps ensure inclusive, high-quality events that inspire and educate developers.
- *Be featured on our website*: Your company logo will appear on codersonly.org with a link to your homepage.
- *Boost team visibility*: Your team members get the "Sponsor" role on Discord, giving them extra visibility in the community and subtly strengthening your employer brand.
- *Gain exposure at our events*: Your logo will be presented at the beginning of each event, including workshops, talks and full-day gatherings.
- *Be included in our event promotions*: We will include a link to your homepage in event invitations sent to our community.
- *Support for your employer branding*: Show your support for the local tech scene and get noticed by engineers who care about quality, learning, and craft.
- *Simplicity and transparency*: A clear annual sponsorship of CHF 1’000.- (excl. VAT) gives you all the benefits—no tiers, no upsells.
- *Easy onboarding*: You just send us your logo, a link to your website, and a contact person—we’ll handle the rest.
- *Flexible commitment*: Sponsorship runs indefinitely but can be cancelled every year with one month’s notice.
