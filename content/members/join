Nice having you here fellow coder! 🧑‍💻

It's good you're double checking what you're running on your computer.
As you'll notice, we have absolutely no bad intents and won't try to pwn you
base.

This script just asks you for you data and sends it to our association
management system. Double check and if you dare, run it on you machine 😉
