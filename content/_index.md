# Hello There!

We are a community of software developers who find that even with decades of experience, there’s always room to learn, to grow, to get better at our craft.
So if you’re also passionate about code and are in Zurich, you’ve come to the right place.

We are a registered association in Zurich – join or support us!
Our upcoming events you can find on Twitter and on Meetup.
Please also add yourself to our Mailing List.
Most importantly though, come around to one of our Coders Monthly sessions!
