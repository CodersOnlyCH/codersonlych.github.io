We hosted the 2024 Zürich edition of Socrates Day (Software Craft and Testing), an international conference. It is an annually occurring unconference where developers, admins and testers meet up and spontaneously organize themselves into discussion groups.

We spent the whole day discussing and debating – it is always a surprise how wide the discussions go. It’s also a safe environment in which to discover new ideas and new technologies.

Our heartfelt thanks go to our generous sponsor, Ergon Informatik AG, who graciously provided the location and put up a generous spread for our post-event round of beers. Also, a shout-out to our other sponsors, bbv Software Services Ltd, Bring! Labs AG, finnova AG Bankware, House of Test Switzerland and megazord.studio, without whose help we could not make these events.

Special mention to daniel koller, who helped out with the registration and the infrastructure, and Bianca Toedtli who coordinated everything!
