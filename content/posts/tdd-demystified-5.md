Ok, so thanks to all who joined us during the school-holidays for our next practice round that we again spent on our fancy new static site generator aka transmogrifier. This was not always without challenge, so extra thanks to all sticking around until the end.

And based on the experience of having to spend too much time and attention on designing the solution and fighting with the language, all to the cost of actual testing insights, in the next session we shall go back to our trusty old playground that is Cinema Paradiso. See you there!
