Hey thanks to all of you joining our third session, about Getting into The Flow. The idea sprang from the struggles of the second workshop and so we set out to work on an already specified interface with sequenced test flow, this time creating a Seat Allocator for our renowned Cinema Paradiso.

And simpler it was and smoother it went, but… we find there’s still room to better anchor the experience of making small steps in quick succession. One challenge we identified was that resolving business expectations, working on the flow and discussing the art of testing all at the same time is too much. Hence the next session shall focus on the latter, on the minutiae that bring about good tests.

Stay tuned!
