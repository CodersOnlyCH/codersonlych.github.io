So in the second session we took TDD Back to Basics and after watching and discussing the Roman Numerals Kata we went to create a Price Engine for our Cinema Paradiso. And we found that with TDD The Flow is hard to get into, so that’s what we’ll do next. And then I forgot to take a screenshot while we were 16 so here’s only one from the latter part of the session. Join us for the next one!
